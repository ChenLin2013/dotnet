Program Description:

In standard text input mode each key can be used to input the letters of the alphabet and the space character.  For example, to access the letter ．b・ the user would press the ．2・ key twice.  
It takes a user a minimum of 100 ms to press a key.  If a user has to use the same key to input consecutive characters there must be at least a 0.5 second pause for the phone to accept that the next key press represents a new character.  
Write a console application in the .Net language of your choice which accepts any string/text that can be entered using the key assignments in the grid.  The application should calculate, and display in the console window, the minimum time required to input using the key pad and the sequence of keys that would be required.
